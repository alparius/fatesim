So this is going to be simplest game ever, the point is that I want to implement this on several different platforms, frameworks, languages etc. Later on I'm will select a the solutions I liked the most and add some more features to it.

My final goals are to deploy it on a proper domain with AWS or something of this sort, and to release it on Google Play and on the App Store.

Game logic will be detailed in an issue after the first implementation.

### The Most Ambitious Plan Ever:

#### Backend:
* Golang with Mux/Gin 
* Node.js with Express 
* Python with Django 
* Python with Flask 
* Ruby on Rails 
* PHP with Laravel/Lumen 
* Java/Kotlin with SpringBoot
* C# with Entity Framework 

#### Frontend: 
* React 
* React Nativeionic cor
* Angular 
* Vue 
* Ember 
* Java/Kotlin
* Ionic and Cordova 

#### Database
* something SQL (like PostreSQL)
* something NoSQL (like MongoDB)
